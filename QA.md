            The Dragon Boat Festival, also called Double Fifth Festival, is celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth moon of the lunar calendar.
    
            The origin of this summer festival centers around a scholarly(博学的) government official named Qu Yuan. He was a good and respected man, but because of the misdeeds(罪行) of jealous(嫉妒) rivals he eventually fell into disfavor in the emperor's court.
    
            Unable to regain the respect of the emperor, in his sorrow Qu Yuan threw himself into the Mi Low river. Because of their admiration for Qu Yuan, the local people living adjacent to the Mi Lo River rushed into their boats to search for him while throwing rice into the waters to appease the river dragons.  Although they were unable to find Qu Yuan, their efforts are still commemorated today during the Dragon Boat Festival.
